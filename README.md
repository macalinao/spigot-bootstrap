spigot-bootstrap
==================
A bootstrap server for Spigot. Features a script that sets the entire server up for you. I made this so I could set up a new Minecraft server really easily.

To set things up, run `update.sh` with `sh update.sh`. This just downloads Spigot. In the future, it may download some "essential" plugins too.
